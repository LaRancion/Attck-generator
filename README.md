# Attck-generator

The idea of this script is to generate a layer of the att&ck navigator (mitre) by prompting the user some simple questions.
like a simple list of techniques with a score will generate the matrix.

I didnt find anything similar on the internet, so i decided to make one, if the creator of a similar tool encounters this one please reach out so we can save the world from the creation of a duplicate utility.

the only purpose of it is to create the graphic for reports and visual navigation, while saving time and removing the search for every technique and subtechnique on the matrix.

PS. techniques id must be known
